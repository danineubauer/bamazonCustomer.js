### About the app: :see_no_evil:

This is the first Node & MySQL assignment of the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp. The goal of this assignment was to practice building databases and accessing them through the server to read & modify them (delete/modify/add data, etc.). 

### Programs & technology used: :speak_no_evil:

The program languaged used to build this application is Javascript. To allow for Javascript to run in the server, I used Node.js and npm packages such as: 

* inquirer 
* mysql. 

The inquirer package allows for the user to communicate with the server and inquire about which product they are interested in and how much of the product they would like to purchase. After the inquiry, the mysql package, allows us to read the data from mysql, display it and modify it accordly.
